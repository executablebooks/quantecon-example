    "\n",
    "-   What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of Python for these\n",

    "-   What are the main elements of the scientific Python ecosystem?\n",
    "-   How is the situation changing over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scientific Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\\'s briefly review Python\\'s scientific libraries, starting with why\n",
    "we need them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Role of Scientific Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "One obvious reason we use scientific libraries is because they implement\n",
    "routines we want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, it\\'s almost always better to use an existing routine for\n",
    "root finding than to write a new one from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "(For standard algorithms, efficiency is maximized if the community can\n",
    "coordinate on a common set of implementations, written by experts and\n",
    "tuned by users to be as fast and robust as possible.)\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is not the only reason that we use Python\\'s scientific\n",
    "libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another is that pure Python, while flexible and elegant, is not fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need libraries that are designed to accelerate execution of Python\n",
    "code.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we\\'ll see below, there are now Python libraries that can do this\n",
    "extremely well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\\'s Scientific Ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of popularity, the big four in the world of scientific Python\n",
    "libraries are\n",
    "\n",
    "-   NumPy\n",
    "-   SciPy\n",
    "-   Matplotlib\n",
    "-   Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "For us, there\\'s another (relatively new) library that will also be\n",
    "essential for numerical computing:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Numba\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the next few lectures we\\'ll see how to use these libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first, let\\'s quickly review how they fit together.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   NumPy forms the foundations by providing a basic array data type\n",
    "    (think of vectors and matrices) and functions for acting on these\n",
    "    arrays (e.g., matrix multiplication).\n",
    "-   SciPy builds on NumPy by adding the kinds of numerical methods that\n",
    "    are routinely used in science (interpolation, optimization, root\n",
    "    finding, etc.).\n",
    "-   Matplotlib is used to generate figures, with a focus on plotting\n",
    "    data stored in NumPy arrays.\n",
    "-   Pandas provides types and functions for empirical work (e.g.,\n",
    "    manipulating data).\n",
    "-   Numba accelerates execution via JIT compilation --- we\\'ll learn\n",
    "    about this soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Need for Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let\\'s discuss execution speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher-level languages like Python are optimized for humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the programmer can leave many details to the runtime\n",
    "environment\n",
    "\n",
    "-   specifying variable types\n",
    "-   memory allocation/deallocation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The upside is that, compared to low-level languages, Python is typically\n",
    "faster to write, less error-prone and easier to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside is that Python is harder to optimize --- that is, turn\n",
    "into fast machine code --- than languages like C or Fortran.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, the standard implementation of Python (called CPython) cannot\n",
    "match the speed of compiled languages such as C or Fortran.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does that mean that we should just switch to C or Fortran for\n",
    "everything?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is: No, no and one hundred times no!\n",
    "\n",
    "(This is what you should say to the senior professor insisting that the\n",
    "model needs to be rewritten in Fortran or C++.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two reasons why:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, for any given program, relatively few lines are ever going to be\n",
    "time-critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence it is far more efficient to write most of our code in a high\n",
    "productivity language like Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, even for those lines of code that *are* time-critical, we can\n",
    "now achieve the same speed as C or Fortran using Python\\'s scientific\n",
    "libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where are the Bottlenecks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we learn how to do this, let\\'s try to understand why plain\n",
    "vanilla Python is slower than C or Fortran.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will, in turn, help us figure out how to speed things up.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Data Access\n",
    "\n",
    "Another drag on speed for high-level languages is data access.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, let\\'s consider the problem of summing some data ---\n",
    "say, a collection of integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summing with Compiled Code\n",
    "\n",
    "In C or Fortran, these integers would typically be stored in an array,\n",
    "which is a simple data structure for storing homogeneous data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such an array is stored in a single contiguous block of memory\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In modern computers, memory addresses are allocated to each byte\n",
    "    (one byte = 8 bits).\n",
    "-   For example, a 64 bit integer is stored in 8 bytes of memory.\n",
    "-   An array of $n$ such integers occupies $8n$ **consecutive** memory\n",
    "    slots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the compiler is made aware of the data type by the programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In this case 64 bit integers\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, each successive data point can be accessed by shifting forward in\n",
    "memory space by a known and fixed amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In this case 8 bytes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summing in Pure Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python tries to replicate these ideas to some degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the standard Python implementation (CPython), list\n",
    "elements are placed in memory locations that are in a sense contiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these list elements are more like pointers to data rather than\n",
    "actual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, there is still overhead involved in accessing the data values\n",
    "themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a considerable drag on speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, it\\'s generally true that memory traffic is a major culprit\n",
    "when it comes to slow execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\\'s look at some ways around these problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a clever method called **vectorization** that can be used to\n",
    "speed up high level languages in numerical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is to send array processing operations in batch to\n",
    "pre-compiled and efficient native machine code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine code itself is typically compiled from carefully optimized C\n",
    "or Fortran.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when working in a high level language, the operation of\n",
    "inverting a large matrix can be subcontracted to efficient machine code\n",
    "that is pre-compiled for this purpose and supplied to users as part of a\n",
    "package.\n",
    "\n",
    "This clever idea dates back to MATLAB, which uses vectorization\n",
    "extensively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectorization can greatly accelerate many numerical computations (but\n",
    "not all, as we shall see).\n",
